# Payment by Results (PbR)

*July 2021*

## OVERVIEW

Payment by results is a system that hospitals can use to charge their patients based on the diagnosis and treatment given to the patient. The price of each diagnosis and treatment will be given a tariff associated with its international code and stored on the system. When a patient visits a doctor, the doctor fills up the diagnosis and treatment ordered for the particular patient then based on the doctor's notes, the system calculates the fee the patient should pay.
The app we build will have two types of users, patient and doctor.
